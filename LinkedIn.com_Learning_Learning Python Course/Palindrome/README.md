# Project Description

### Assignment
For this challenge, we're going to create a program that detects whether a string of characters is a **palindrome**. 
and a palindrome is a string that reads the same way both forward and backward, minus any white space or punctuation.  
Palindrome Examples:
- Anna
- civic
- my gym
- red rum, sir, is murder
- I did, did I?
- Madam, I'm Adam.
- 121

So the program starts by asking for these strings to test for a palidrome, or the word 'exit' to stop the program.
